StackChan Core2 JSON Interface provides a Raspberry Pi–driven workflow for controlling the StackChan Core2 toy through newline-delimited JSON commands. The ESP32 firmware parses the provided expression, speech bubble text, palette, and duration, while a companion Python CLI (`control_stackchan.py`) handles serial handshakes, error reporting, and command delivery to `/dev/ttyUSB0`. Documentation covers development setup, testing rituals, troubleshooting notes, and a running journal so contributors can safely extend the JSON bridge and automation scripts.
